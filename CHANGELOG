0.5 - It lives
====================
+ fire method
+ random enemy generation
+ spawn money at set interval frames
+ game over - works but displays multiple dialog windows
+ collision detection
+ different bullets for towers
+ rename variables and methods so they make more sense
+ removed font
+ remove images if they are off screen
+ click and drag events	//hindsight - perhaps bad; what if clicked and don't want to place tower at all
+ if possible, consolidate TowerObject and EnemyObject; abstract class - more OOP inheritance (possibly push back to next update)
+ organize and clean up directories and images
+ better search algorithm for Grid::isAvailable
+ enemy - action() and attack() into one action() method (boolean to see what to do)
+ tower - rename fire() to action()/attack()
+ toString
+ lawn mower to kill all enemies in that row
+ 2d array for grid
+ comment code
+ Background:clickEvent() -> replace selImage with selIndex
+ merge Background::move() and Background::fire() to Background::action()
+ split FinalStand::draw() to FinalStand::draw() and FinalStand::action()
+ make a readme.txt for instructions on how to add more towers; read in attributes from text file (perhaps push to next update)
+ Default L&F for dialog windows in gameOver()
+ Shovel to remove towers. That was surprisingly simple
+ FinalStand bullet collision hits multiple rows (set min/max EnemySpawn to 100 and 150)
+ Work on readme
+ Stock images for enemies and towers and make menu template (.png, .psd and gimp) for towers images
